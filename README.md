# How much load can .NET and SQLite handle?

Source repository for my series of blog posts related to the load that .NET and SQLite can handle.

This repository **does not** contain production ready code. It contains no tests, is likely the ugliest thing you've
ever seen, but it is fit for purpose in terms of verifying and validating the total load that .NET can handle for
small to medium applications.

The idea is that this application will be upgraded as new .NET versions come out, providing a consistent baseline
of performance that is understandable and somehow relates to most developers.
